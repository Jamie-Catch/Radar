Tools like Sentry distinguish themselves from traditional logging solutions such as the ELK Stack in their focus on discovering, investigating and fixing errors. Sentry has been around for a while and supports several languages and frameworks. Thought-works have used Sentry in many projects, and it has been really useful in tracking errors, finding out if a commit actually fixed an issue and alerting us if an issue resurfaces due to a regression."
